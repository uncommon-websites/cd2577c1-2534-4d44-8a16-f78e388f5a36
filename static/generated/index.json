    "prompt": "A modern startup workspace captured in documentary-style realism, featuring a small group of diverse technical professionals (in their 30s-40s) in focused, authentic collaboration. The scene is shot from an intimate middle distance (3-6 feet), with natural daylight streaming through windows and soft, warm-neutral lighting (5000-5500K). Subtle pops of orange appear in environmental elements like coffee mugs or notebook covers, set against a foundation of deep grays and matte-lifted shadows. The team is leaning in over a table scattered with notebooks, coffee cups, and analog tools, deeply engaged in problem-solving—gesturing, sketching, and discussing ideas, with purposeful movement suggesting momentum and rapid iteration. The workspace feels lived-in and dynamic, with industrial/loft accents and the quiet intensity of breakthrough moments. The overall mood is one of focused momentum and pragmatic progress, balancing technical credibility with approachability.",

    "prompt": "A candid, documentary-style photograph of a small group of diverse technical professionals collaborating in a modern, lived-in workspace. The scene features 2-3 people in their 30s-40s, engaged in focused discussion and sketching ideas on paper, surrounded by coffee cups, notebooks, and analog tools. The environment has subtle industrial/loft aesthetics, with natural daylight streaming in, creating a warm-neutral color temperature. Selective pops of orange appear in environmental elements, such as a coffee mug or notebook, while deep blacks and matte-lifted shadows anchor the composition. The perspective is intimate, shot from a middle distance or over-the-shoulder, capturing purposeful movement and the quiet intensity of problem-solving. Negative space and asymmetrical framing highlight the human expertise and dynamic energy of startup culture.",
